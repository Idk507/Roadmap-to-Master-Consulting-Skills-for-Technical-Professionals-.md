### 🔶 1. **Stars**

* **High market share** in a **high-growth** market
* Often leaders in fast-growing markets
* Need significant investment to maintain position

#### ✅ Strategy:

* Invest heavily
* Aim to turn into **Cash Cows** as market growth slows

#### 💡 Example:

* Azure OpenAI service (Microsoft): High usage + rapidly growing GenAI cloud adoption.

---

### 🔷 2. **Cash Cows**

* **High market share** in a **low-growth** market
* Stable, profitable products that require minimal investment
* Provide cash flow to fund Stars and Question Marks

#### ✅ Strategy:

* Maintain position
* Maximize profit and invest in other areas

#### 💡 Example:

* Microsoft Office Suite: Dominant, mature product in a saturated market.

---

### ❓ 3. **Question Marks (Problem Children)**

* **Low market share** in a **high-growth** market
* Potential for growth, but risky
* Need heavy investment to become Stars

#### ✅ Strategy:

* Analyze carefully: **Invest or Divest**
* Conduct market validation, MVPs, POCs

#### 💡 Example:

* A new GenAI-based Legal Assistant: growing interest, but low adoption and unproven ROI.

---

### 🐶 4. **Dogs**

* **Low market share** in a **low-growth** market
* May generate small profits or operate at a loss
* Often candidates for divestment or shutdown

#### ✅ Strategy:

* Divest, harvest, or reposition
* Do not invest heavily unless a pivot is possible

#### 💡 Example:

* Legacy OCR tool in a market moving toward GenAI document understanding.
