## 🛠️ What is Jira?

**Jira** is a **project management and issue tracking tool** by Atlassian. It is widely used for managing:

* Agile software development (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe)
* ML/AI project pipelines
* Consulting engagements (milestones, deliverables, client issues)

## 📅 Sprint Board Views

Jira supports two main Agile board types:

### 1. **Scrum Board**

* Sprint backlog
* Story points
* Burn-down charts

### 2. **Kanban Board**

* Visual columns: `To Do → In Progress → Done`
* WIP limits
* Best for continuous delivery or research-heavy AI/ML tasks

## 🧠 Jira Best Practices for Consultants

### 🧾 1. Write SMART Stories:

```markdown
As a user, I want to upload CSV files and ask questions, 
so I can get quick insights from my data.
```

### 📎 2. Link issues:

* Link bugs to stories
* Link spikes to epics
* Link blockers clearly (`is blocked by`, `relates to`)

### 🧩 3. Use Components & Labels:

* Group related work by tech (e.g., `LangChain`, `RAG`, `OpenAI`)
* Tag by use case: `Healthcare`, `LLM`, `Finance`, etc.

### 🛎 4. Track Dependencies:

* Set priority (`P1`, `P2`)
* Add watchers for stakeholders
* Use checklists in descriptions
