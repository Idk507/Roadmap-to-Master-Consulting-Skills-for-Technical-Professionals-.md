## 📊 **Porter’s Five Forces Framework**

Porter’s model identifies **five key competitive forces** that shape every industry and market. These forces help businesses understand where **power lies** in a business situation and how attractive an industry is in terms of profitability.

---

### 🔷 1. **Competitive Rivalry (Industry Competition)**

**Definition**: The intensity of competition among existing players in the industry.

#### 🔍 Factors that increase rivalry:

* Many competitors of similar size and power
* Slow industry growth
* Low product differentiation
* High fixed or storage costs
* High exit barriers

#### 💡 Example (Retail):

In the fashion industry, **Zara, H\&M, Uniqlo**, and **local brands** compete fiercely on price, speed, and design — driving down profitability.

#### 👇 Implication:

* High rivalry = Price wars, reduced margins, frequent innovation cycles.

---

### 🔷 2. **Threat of New Entrants**

**Definition**: The ease or difficulty with which new competitors can enter the industry and erode existing profits.

#### 🔍 Barriers to entry (which reduce threat):

* Economies of scale
* High capital requirements
* Strong brand loyalty
* Proprietary technology or patents
* Government regulations
* Access to distribution channels

#### 💡 Example (AI SaaS):

While GenAI is booming, **high infrastructure costs, data needs, and trust in models** make it hard for new startups to challenge players like **OpenAI or Anthropic** without strong differentiators.

#### 👇 Implication:

* Low entry barriers = High threat = Lower profitability in long run

---

### 🔷 3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers (Customers)**

**Definition**: The power customers have to influence pricing and terms.

#### 🔍 Buyer power is high when:

* Few buyers purchasing in large volumes
* Products are standardized
* Buyers can switch easily
* Buyers can backward integrate (build their own)

#### 💡 Example (B2B Software):

Large enterprises negotiating with smaller SaaS firms often demand **customizations, lower prices, and long-term support**, exerting high pressure.

#### 👇 Implication:

* High buyer power = Pressure on price, service, and quality.

---

### 🔷 4. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**

**Definition**: The ability of suppliers to influence the cost or availability of inputs.

#### 🔍 Supplier power is high when:

* Few suppliers for a critical input
* Switching costs are high
* Suppliers are more concentrated than the industry
* Suppliers can forward integrate (sell directly)

#### 💡 Example (Chip Industry):

In AI hardware, **NVIDIA** holds significant power due to its **dominance in GPU manufacturing**, affecting pricing for startups needing compute.

#### 👇 Implication:

* High supplier power = Reduced profit margins for firms relying on those suppliers.

---

### 🔷 5. **Threat of Substitutes**

**Definition**: The likelihood of customers switching to alternatives that meet the same need differently.

#### 🔍 Threat is high when:

* Alternatives offer a better price-performance ratio
* Switching cost is low
* Substitutes can disrupt the business model

#### 💡 Example (Transportation):

Ride-hailing services (Uber) face substitution threats from **public transport, scooters, or autonomous vehicles**.

#### 👇 Implication:

* High threat of substitutes = Pressure to innovate, differentiate, or lower prices.

## ✅ How to Use Porter’s Five Forces

| Step | Action                                                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Define your industry scope clearly                             |
| 2    | Analyze each force individually with supporting data           |
| 3    | Assign intensity levels (High / Medium / Low)                  |
| 4    | Identify opportunities (e.g., weak supplier power) and threats |
| 5    | Formulate strategy: differentiation, cost leadership, or niche |

## 🔁 Example: Generative AI in Healthcare

| Force              | Analysis                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rivalry**        | High: Many startups + tech giants entering (Google, Microsoft, startups) |
| **New Entrants**   | Medium: Technical and regulatory barriers present                        |
| **Buyer Power**    | High: Hospitals demand explainability, compliance                        |
| **Supplier Power** | High: NVIDIA GPUs, foundation model providers like OpenAI                |
| **Substitutes**    | Medium: Traditional automation, rule-based systems still used            |

## 🔧 Applications in Consulting and AI Strategy

* **Market Entry Strategy** – Is it worth entering this space?
* **Client Advisory** – Where should they defend/grow/differentiate?
* **Product Positioning** – Build a moat based on weak forces
* **Partnership Strategy** – Manage buyer/supplier power through alliances
